# beatmachine
WebAudio/HTML5 drum machine using TR-606 samples.

Hit the steps to enable, hit the drum names to switch tracks. BPM range is 32-240, but that's okay, it automatically limits itself if you cross the threshold!

Timing can get wonky and it doesn't save anything, so it's just a fun little toy.
